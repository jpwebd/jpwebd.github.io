    <h1>My Story</h1>
    <p>
      I am Jean Paul, a Lebanese 19 year-old guy. I study Chemistry at USJ, Beirut.
      I know what you're gonna say: "chemistry? Really?". I've said it once and I'll say it again, i LOVE chemistry. Anyway, I want to become a cosmetic chemist, which sounds a little more fun.
      Other than that, I'm also in Scouts, it's my 7th year, and I am now an Assistant of Troop.
      Also, I am passionate about fashion and arts, especially french literature. So you may sometimes find me either reading, writing, or analyzing literary works.
      You may now wonder how do I look like. Here's a cool photo of me I took on prom.
