    <h1><em>Literature</em></h1>
    <p>
      I love books. I especially enjoy reading poetry and classical tragedies written by famous authors like Victor Hugo or Jean Racine.
    Here are some books I definitely recommend. All of them are in French, some are literary, others are novels.

  <h2> <em>Phèdre</em>, by Jean Racine, 1677</h2>
  <p>
     This is a tragic play written by French playwriter Racine in the XVIIth century, inspired by Antique Ages.<br />
     It is the story of Phèdre, a queen in Ancient Greece whose husband, King Thésée, dies on one of his adventures (or does he? ;) ). The queen, cursed by Venus, goddess of love, falls in love with her step son Hipolyte.<br /> Unable to hold her secret in, she reveals her passion towards him, and that's where things get twisted.

  <h2><em>Les Contemplations</em>, by Victor Hugo, 1856</h1>
<p>
  After the tragic death of his wife and daughter in a car accident, Victor Hugo releases a book of poems that changes the world of French Literature forever.<br />
    This book holds one of the most amazing poems in French Literature, "Demain, dès l'aube", a poem in which he tells his readers how eager he is to go to his daughter's grave.<br /></font>
<br />
<em>Demain, dès l'aube, à l'heure où blanchit la campagne,<br />
Je partirai. Vois-tu, je sais que tu m'attends.</em> <br /> <br />
 LITERAL CHILLS.
