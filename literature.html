      I love books. I especially enjoy reading poetry and classical tragedies written by famous authors like Victor Hugo or Jean Racine.
    Here are some books I definitely recommend. All of them are in French, some are literary, others are novels.

  <h2 style="color:white;"> <em>Phèdre</em>, by Jean Racine</h2>
  <p style="color:white;">
     <font size="+1">This is a tragic play written by French playwriter Racine in the XVIIth century, inspired by Antique Ages.<br />
     It is the story of Phedre, a queen in Ancient Greece whose husband, King Thésée, dies on one of his adventures (or does he? ;) ). The queen, cursed by Venus, goddess of love, falls in love with her step son Hipolyte.<br /> Unable to hold her secret in, she reveals her passion towards him, and that's where things get twisted. </font>
